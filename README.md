# Catalyzed Chemistry

A website hub for learning Chemistry. 

This website was made for the FBLA Website Design Event's 2025-2026 prompt.

## Tech Stack

This is a static website made with HTML, TailwindCSS, Javascript, and jQuery. 

There is no server.

## Set up Dev Enviornment

This is admittedly kind of a note-to-self thing.

To set up the Dev Enviornment:
1. Open root folder
2. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies (TailwindCSS CLI)
3. Run ```npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/original-style.css -o ./style.css --watch``` to have the TailwindCSS CLI watch for changes and recompile the CSS.
4. Get Developing :)
